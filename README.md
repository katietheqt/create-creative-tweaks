# Create: Creative Tweaks
Various technical tweaks useful for technical players. Contains many client-only tweaks compatible with vanilla Create
server installs. All features are individually configurable and disabled by default.

**This mod is primarily for my own use! I am publishing it because I hope it will be useful, but I am not planning to maintain it particularly effectively or add features unless I want to.**

## Features
- permanent goggles in creative (configurable)
- placing cogs in "illegal" positions
- burn time on the blaze burner tooltip
- visualisation of contraption actor/storage/assembly order
- lots more (see the in-game config menu for the full list)
